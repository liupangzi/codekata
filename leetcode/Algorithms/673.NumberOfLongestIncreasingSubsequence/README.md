Given an unsorted array of integers, find the number of longest increasing subsequence.

**Example 1:**
<pre>
<b>Input:</b> [1,3,5,4,7]
<b>Output:</b> 2
<b>Explanation:</b> The two longest increasing subsequence are [1, 3, 4, 7] and [1, 3, 5, 7].
</pre>

**Example 2:**
<pre>
<b>Input:</b> [2,2,2,2,2]
<b>Output:</b> 5
<b>Explanation:</b> The length of longest continuous increasing subsequence is 1, and there are 5 subsequences' length is 1, so output 5.
</pre>

**Note:** Length of the given array will be not exceed 2000 and the answer is guaranteed to be fit in 32-bit signed int.
