Given an integer array *nums*, find the sum of the elements between indices *i* and *j* (*i* ≤ *j*), inclusive.

**Example:**

```
Given nums = [-2, 0, 3, -5, 2, -1]

sumRange(0, 2) -> 1
sumRange(2, 5) -> -1
sumRange(0, 5) -> -3
```

**Note:**

 1. You may assume that the array does not change.
 2. There are many calls to *sumRange* function.
