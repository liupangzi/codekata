### 2174.Pomekon Collection

Since it was officially released Pomekon in Brazil, Dabriel is trying to realize his biggest dream: Being a Master Pomekon. His goal is to conquer the 151 Pomekons available. He managed to capture many monsters, but in his city appear many repeated Pomekons, causing he to capture several times the same Pomekon.

Seeing that his bag is pretty full, Dabriel asked you to do a computer program to inform him how many Pomekons are missing to complete the collection.

**Input**

The first line of the test case consists of an integer **N** (1 ≤ **N** ≤ 10<sup>3</sup>), representing the amount of Pomekons that Dabriel already captured.

The next **N** lines consists of a string **S** (1 ≤ **|S|** ≤ 10<sup>3</sup>) representing the name of each Pomekon. The name of each Pomekon consists only of uppercase and lowercase letters.

**Output**

You should print: "Falta(m) **X** pomekon(s).", where **X** is the amount Pomekons not captured.
