A unit fraction contains 1 in the numerator. The decimal representation of the unit fractions with denominators 2 to 10 are given:

<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub>	= 	0.5

<sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub>	= 	0.(3)

<sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub>	= 	0.25

<sup>1</sup>/<sub>5</sub>	= 	0.2

<sup>1</sup>/<sub>6</sub>	= 	0.1(6)

<sup>1</sup>/<sub>7</sub>	= 	0.(142857)

<sup>1</sup>/<sub>8</sub>	= 	0.125

<sup>1</sup>/<sub>9</sub>	= 	0.(1)

<sup>1</sup>/<sub>10</sub>  = 	0.1

Where 0.1(6) means 0.166666..., and has a 1-digit recurring cycle. It can be seen that <sup>1</sup>/<sub>7</sub> has a 6-digit recurring cycle.

Find the value of *d* < 1000 for which <sup>1</sup>/<sub>*d*</sub> contains the longest recurring cycle in its decimal fraction part.
