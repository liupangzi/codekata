Given an array of **2n** integers, your task is to group these integers into **n** pairs of integer, say (a<sub>1</sub>, b<sub>1</sub>), (a<sub>2</sub>, b<sub>2</sub>), ..., (a<sub>n</sub>, b<sub>n</sub>) which makes sum of min(a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub>) for all i from 1 to n as large as possible.

**Example 1:**
<pre>
<b>Input:</b> [1,4,3,2]

<b>Output:</b> 4
<b>Explanation:</b> n is 2, and the maximum sum of pairs is 4.
</pre>

**Note:**

 1. **n** is a positive integer, which is in the range of [1, 10000].
 2. All the integers in the array will be in the range of [-10000, 10000].
