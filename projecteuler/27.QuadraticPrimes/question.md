Euler discovered the remarkable quadratic formula:

<center>*n<sup>2</sup> + n + 41*</center>

It turns out that the formula will produce 40 primes for the consecutive integer values *0 ≤ n ≤ 39*. However, when *n = 40*, *40<sup>2</sup> + 40 + 41 = 40(40 + 1) + 41* is divisible by 41, and certainly when *n = 41*, *41<sup>2</sup> + 41 + 41* is clearly divisible by 41.

The incredible formula *n<sup>2</sup> − 79n + 1601* was discovered, which produces 80 primes for the consecutive values *0 ≤ n ≤ 79*. The product of the coefficients, −79 and 1601, is −126479.

Considering quadratics of the form:

*n<sup>2</sup> + an + b*, where *|a| < 1000* and *|b| ≤ 1000*

- where |*n*| is the modulus/absolute value of *n*
e.g. |11| = 11 and |−4| = 4

Find the product of the coefficients, *a* and *b*, for the quadratic expression that produces the maximum number of primes for consecutive values of *n*, starting with *n = 0*.
