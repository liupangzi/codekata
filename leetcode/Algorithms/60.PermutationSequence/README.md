The set `[1,2,3,…,n]` contains a total of *n*! unique permutations.

By listing and labeling all of the permutations in order, we get the following sequence (ie, for n = 3):

 1. `"123"`
 2. `"132"`
 3. `"213"`
 4. `"231"`
 5. `"312"`
 6. `"321"`

Given *n* and *k*, return the *k*<sup>th</sup> permutation sequence.

**Note:** Given *n* will be between 1 and 9 inclusive.
