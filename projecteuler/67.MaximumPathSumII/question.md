By starting at the top of the triangle below and moving to adjacent numbers on the row below, the maximum total from top to bottom is 23.

```
   3
  7 4
 2 4 6
8 5 9 3
```

That is, 3 + 7 + 4 + 9 = 23.

Find the maximum total from top to bottom in [triangle.txt][1] (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'), a 15K text file containing a triangle with one-hundred rows.

**NOTE:** This is a much more difficult version of [Problem 18][2]. It is not possible to try every route to solve this problem, as there are 2<sup>99</sup> altogether! If you could check one trillion (10<sup>12</sup>) routes every second it would take over twenty billion years to check them all. There is an efficient algorithm to solve it. ;o)
