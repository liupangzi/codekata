### 1873.Rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock

Rock-paper -scissors - lizard - Spock is an expansion of the classical method of selection for playing rock-paper- scissors. It operates under the same basic principle , but includes two other additional weapons : the lizard (formed by the hand like a puppet 's mouth ) and Spock ( formed by greeting the Vulcans in Star Trek ) . This reduces the chances of a round end in a draw . The game was invented by Sam Kass and Karen Bryla like " Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock ." In this version, the possible outcomes are:

 - Scissors cuts paper
 - Paper covers rock
 - Rock tips lizard
 - Lizard Spock falls asleep
 - Spock melts scissors
 - Scissors holds lizard
 - lizard eats paper
 - Paper disproves spock
 - Spock vaporizes rock
 - Rock crushes scissors

In Portuguese, this game is called "Pedra-papel-tesoura-lagarto-Spock", and the weapons are "pedra" (rock), "papel" (paper), "tesoura" (scissors), "lagarto" (lizard) and "Spock" (Spock).
