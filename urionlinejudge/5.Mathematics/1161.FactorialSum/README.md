Read two numbers M and N indefinitely. Calculate and write the sum of their factorial. Be carefull, because the result can have more than 15 digits.

**Input**

The input file contains many test cases. Each test case contains two integer numbers M (0 ≤ M ≤ 20) and N (0 ≤ N ≤ 20). The end of file is determined by eof.

**Output**

For each test case in the input your program must print a single line, containing a number that is the sum of the both factorial (M and N).

| Input Sample | Output Sample |
| ------------ | ------------- |
| 4 4 | 48 |
| 0 0 | 2 |
