Given two non-negative numbers `num1` and `num2` represented as string, return the sum of `num1` and `num2`.

**Note:**

 1. The length of both `num1` and `num2` is < 5100.
 2. Both `num1` and `num2` contains only digits `0-9`.
 3. Both `num1` and `num2` does not contain any leading zero.
 4. You **must not use any built-in BigInteger library** or **convert the inputs to integer** directly.
