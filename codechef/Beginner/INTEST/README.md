### Enormous Input Test

The purpose of this problem is to verify whether the method you are using to read input data is sufficiently fast to handle problems branded with the **enormous Input/Output** warning. You are expected to be able to process at least 2.5MB of input data per second at runtime.

**Input**

The input begins with two positive integers n k (n, k<=10<sup>7</sup>). The next n lines of input contain one positive integer t<sub>i</sub>, not greater than 10<sup>9</sup>, each.

**Output**

Write a single integer to output, denoting how many integers t<sub>i</sub> are divisible by k.

**Example**
