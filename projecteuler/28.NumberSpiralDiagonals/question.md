Starting with the number 1 and moving to the right in a clockwise direction a 5 by 5 spiral is formed as follows:

<center>
**21** 22 23 24 **25**
20  **&nbsp;&nbsp;7**  &nbsp;&nbsp;8  **&nbsp;&nbsp;9** 10
19  &nbsp;&nbsp;6  **&nbsp;&nbsp;1**  &nbsp;&nbsp;2 11
18  **&nbsp;&nbsp;5**  &nbsp;&nbsp;4  **&nbsp;&nbsp;3** 12
**17** 16 15 14 **13**
</center>

It can be verified that the sum of the numbers on the diagonals is 101.

What is the sum of the numbers on the diagonals in a 1001 by 1001 spiral formed in the same way?
