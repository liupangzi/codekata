Given a **non-empty** integer array, find the minimum number of moves required to make all array elements equal, where a move is incrementing a selected element by 1 or decrementing a selected element by 1.

You may assume the array's length is at most 10,000.

**Example:**

<pre>
<b>Input:</b>
[1,2,3]

<b>Output:</b>
2

<b>Explanation:</b>
Only two moves are needed (remember each move increments or decrements one element):

[1,2,3]  =>  [2,2,3]  =>  [2,2,2]
</pre>
