Write a SQL query to get the *n*<sup>th</sup> highest salary from the `Employee` table.

```
+----+--------+
| Id | Salary |
+----+--------+
| 1  | 100    |
| 2  | 200    |
| 3  | 300    |
+----+--------+
```

For example, given the above Employee table, the *n*<sup>th</sup> highest salary where *n* = 2 is `200`. If there is no *n*<sup>th</sup> highest salary, then the query should return `null`.
