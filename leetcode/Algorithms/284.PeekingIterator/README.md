Given an Iterator class interface with methods: `next()` and `hasNext()`, design and implement a PeekingIterator that support the `peek()` operation -- it essentially peek() at the element that will be returned by the next call to next().

<hr>

Here is an example. Assume that the iterator is initialized to the beginning of the list: `[1, 2, 3]`.

Call `next()` gets you 1, the first element in the list.

Now you call `peek()` and it returns 2, the next element. Calling `next()` after that still returns 2.

You call `next()` the final time and it returns 3, the last element. Calling `hasNext()` after that should return false.
