The [Hamming distance][1] between two integers is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different.

Given two integers `x` and `y`, calculate the Hamming distance.

**Note:**

0 ≤ `x`, `y` < 2<sup>31</sup>.

**Example:**

<pre>
<b>Input:</b> x = 1, y = 4

<b>Output:</b> 2

<b>Explanation:</b>
1   (0 0 0 1)
4   (0 1 0 0)

The above arrows point to positions where the corresponding bits are different.
