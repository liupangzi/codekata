### 1871.Zero means Zero

One day Prof. Humberto José Roberto made ​​the following question: If the zero to the left of a number has no value , why would other positions of a number? Analyzing as follows , it asks for your help , to add two integer values ​​, the result is displayed according to his reasoning , that is, without the zeros . For example , to add 15 + 5, the result would be 20 , but with this new idea, the new result would be 2 , and to add 99 + 6 , the result would be 105, but with this new idea , the new result would be 15.

Write a program that , given two integers without the digit zero , some the same and, if the result has a zero digit, which remove them before display .

**Input**

There will be several test cases . Each test case begins with two integers M and N ( 1 ≤ M ≤ N ≤ 999,999,999).

The last test case is indicated when C = M = 0 , and this case should not be processed.

**Output**

For each test case , print the sum of the two values ​​without Zeros .


| Input Sample | Output Sample |
| ------------ | ------------- |
| 7 8 | 15 |
| 15 5 | 2 |
| 99 6 | 15 |
| 0 0 |  |
