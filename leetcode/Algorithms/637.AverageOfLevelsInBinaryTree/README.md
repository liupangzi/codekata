Given a non-empty binary tree, return the average value of the nodes on each level in the form of an array.

**Example 1:**
<pre>
<b>Input:</b>
    3
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7
<b>Output:</b> [3, 14.5, 11]
<b>Explanation:</b>
The average value of nodes on level 0 is 3,  on level 1 is 14.5, and on level 2 is 11. Hence return [3, 14.5, 11].
</pre>

**Note:**
 1. The range of node's value is in the range of 32-bit signed integer.
