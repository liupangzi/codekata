Rafael recently won a scholarship and is studying outside of Brazil, where he met several people from several different nationalities. The native language of this country is English, and all the people that Rafael met speak English as either first or second language.

As learning a second language is a hard and tiring task, some people prefer to talk in their own native language whenever possible. One exception to this rule is when there are two people in the group that doesn't have the same native language. In this kind of situation, the language they speak is English.

For example, if there is a group with only brazilians, the spoken language will be Portuguese, but if there is a spanish person between them, the spoken language will be English.

Rafael sometimes get confused about which language should be spoken in each group of people, and then he asked your help.
